   * Welcome! Add your end-to-end tests for the {{ name }} integration here.
   * Note that these are not unit tests, and should not be treated as such.
   * We just want to make sure that the integration settings function
   * correctly, etc.
   *
   * If you need an example I'd recommend taking a look at an existing core
   * integration test file, such as this:
   * https://github.com/luckyorange/integrations/blob/master/packages/google-analytics/core/cypress/integration/gtag.js
   *
   * To preview the demo site that Cypress loads to run these tests use the
   * `npm run demo` command and go to https://localhost:5000
