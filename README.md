# fake-integrations

This repository contains placeholder ("fake") integrations for various external tools and platforms. These integrations are not fully functional; they act as stand-ins for the real implementations. This helps in prototyping, testing, or simulating interactions without requiring the actual external services.

## What's Inside

Each integration typically includes:
- A configuration file (usually `integration.config.js`) that defines key properties like the integration's unique `id`, `name`, and a brief `description`.
- (Optionally) Custom tabs can be added to display in the app.

## To Upgrade
Run the command: `node upgrade-fake-integrations.js`
